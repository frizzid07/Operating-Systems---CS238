Implementing a key value store (Read up)

DO NOT USE sda block devices for this project, NvMe drives or loop devices can be used
lsblk to list devices

5 tests to pass- basic logic, heavy rewrite, read write single, read wwrite small, read write large

dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/file bs=4096 count=10000

Abstraction: kvraw -> logfs -> device

sudo ./cs238 /dev/<block device>
